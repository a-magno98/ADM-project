# ADM-project
## AIM OF THE PROJECT
The goal of the project is two folds:

- **PART I + PART II, for all the students**: the design and the development of the large-scale data management/data processing layer for a specific application at your choice. To this aim, you can rely on any NoSQL system presented in the context of the  Advanced Data Management course (Riak, Redis, Cassandra, MongoDB, Neo4j).
- **PART III, only for Computer Science students**: modeling, in RDF, RDFS and OWL, some requirements and query them through SPARQL.
